# tableau_maps_scatterplots_-_dashboards
My first dashboard with Tableau, using super-market data:
  - the dashboard contains a profit margin map and customer profit scatter-plot used to highlight regions in Europe by profit
  - a sliding scale was implemented to be able to filter data by year
  - interacting with the map will adjust the scatter-plot in tandem
